# Calne Community Sensors

This is a Ruby on Rails project designed to collate air quality data from community and public sources and make it available in a standard format.

## Sensors

The app collects metadata about community sensors. This will be used to fetch and process sensor data from the [sensor.community](https://sensor.community) project.

It will also make it possible to enter data from other sources to provide a complete picture of air quality in the town.

## Data

The app will make air quality data available in JSON format for re-use.
